# Leap-Year-Calculator
Do you need to know when a year is a leap year?

This application will help you determine if any year is a leap year (After the Gregorian Calendar went into effect).

You can copy this Code into any Python reader that has an interpreter and a console/IDE.

Please feel free to use this as a base and please let me see your results, would love to see it LIVE in an app of a sort!
